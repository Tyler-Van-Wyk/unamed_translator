# unamed_translator

This python program will take a full file path as input, translate the filenames into English using the Google Translate API, then rename those files to the translated file name. The program will let you view
the translation before you commit to renaming the file. The source language should be autodetected with the testing I have done. This file <b>DOES NOT</b> translate the contents of these files, only the file names.
